The algorithm in this repo is inspired about the paper ***"How people talk about health? Detecting Health Topics from Twitter Streams"***.
The authors propose an online and incremental method for clustering streams of tweets with the aim of detecting interesting topics in Healthcare.

abstract = {The paper proposes an online clustering algorithm for detecting health-related topics. The method extracts from the tweets relevant terms and incrementally groups them by taking into account both term occurrences and tweet age. A detailed experimentation on the tweets posted by users in US shows that the method is capable to group tweets addressing common health issues into the pertinent topic, outperforming traditional topic model approaches, like Doc-p and LDA.},
